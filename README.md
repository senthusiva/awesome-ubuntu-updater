# Script Toolbox

## About
In the Script Toolbox you will find a collection of scripts that I have created and will create in the future. I am using this opportunity to learn more about scripting. The scripts were made with the help of Linux man pages and the StackOverflow community. If you find a bug or have a feature request, you're welcome to create an issue.

Thank you and have fun with the scripts.
